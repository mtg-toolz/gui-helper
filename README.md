# GUI tool for Proximity

Things may break or change with proximity, I have a life and family so I will do my best to fix it but pull requests are always welcomed! The backend being in rust means its easy to extend this tool to work with almost any language using FFI or sending cli's.

# Local setup from .msi

MUST HAVE JAVA 16+ installed and Python 3 installed before running!

* Download and install the msi into a folder from the release page this is built via github action from source(automagically), please fill free to use virustotal, sandboxie or build it yourself if you want
* Download/Add proximity.jar to the folder link [here](https://github.com/Haven-King/Proximity/releases)
* Download/Add the template folder(chillis) from the above link and unzipped to the same folder
* Download/Add autofill.exe to the folder link [here](https://github.com/chilli-axe/mpc-autofill/releases)
* Download/Add cardxml to the folder can be found [here](https://github.com/Tarnop/CardXML)
* Add a cardback.png img (but be named cardback!) can get this from a lot of places 
* Add your deck list as a text file must follow proximity format follow the wiki for proximity if unsure 
When done it should look like this * might have a different version that is fine!

# Local setup from source

So first things first this is not built for people to run locally if you don't have some tech knowledge. I will do my best to walk you through all of this as if you had none. Some things you need need installed are the following. Node 14, Visual Studios C++ build tools 2019! uninstall 2017 if you have issues, RustC and Cargo package manager (rustup) makes this easy. Lastly you need to install webview2 and your ready to go to the next steps.
Go ahead and clone or download this repo wherever you would like and then open it up in your editor of choice, I like vscode.
Once you have it open, open a terminal in the root folder ctrl/cmd + ` on windows/mac will do this then run the commands in order
npm i (this will take a long time the first time)
npm run start
OPEN ANOTHER SEPARATE TERMINAL!! VERY IMPORTANT! Then run
npm run tauri dev (will take a long time first time around!)

# Deploy setup

If you don't know what this is or how to do it, simply download the released ver of the program or try to figure this out on your own. This step should not be needed by none devs.

npm run build
npm run tauri build
